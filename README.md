** This game is unfinished **

Fairly simple project that was done to learn a bit of Godot. It is a simple game with a main menu, some customization screens and was intended to be a Worms clone featuring bunnies instead. It was abandoned when I realized that building multiplayer into a game after the fact is much harder, especially so when it was the first time using Godot.
